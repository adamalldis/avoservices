                <h3>Electro Static Disinfecting</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Electrostatic spraying provides significantly better coverage of surfaces, as opposed to a typical directional sprayer. Electrically charged liquids create a fine mist through the air which has a 360° wrap around effect. This allows the disinfectant to reach especially tight spaces that conventional disinfecting methods would otherwise miss. These charged droplets spread evenly and reduce dripping, making for a much neater application and easier clean up. It also fights odours and mold, and germs are completely eradicated upon contact with the disinfectant.</p>
